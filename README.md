# Token Holder Verifier

**Token Holder Verifier** is a Telegram bot with a React-based mini-app that verifies users as holders of a specific Jetton (token) on the TON blockchain.

Users connect their TON wallet via TON Connect. If they hold a sufficient amount of the required Jetton, the bot grants them access to a private Telegram group.

This project is built with:
- [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) for the Telegram bot backend  
- [React](https://react.dev/) for the client-side mini-app
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
